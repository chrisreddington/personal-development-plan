#### Behaviour Pattern Assessment Results

**Supporting – Analysing (S – A)**
Systematic approach. Detail oriented. Perceived as cautious, determined in accomplishing their goals. Tend to take things personally and worry about conflict, rather than dealing with it.  Often prefer working alone, but work well with small groups. Can be counted on even when things are difficult.

**Supporting – Influencing (S – I)**
Warmth. Openness. Understanding. Friendship. Loyal to relationships/organizations. Perception of value is 'linked to whether others or not like me'. Strongly affected by conflict. Often carry the burdens home. 

### Opportunities

* **Building and leading communities** – Inspiring others to come along on a journey (influencing for impact without authority), whether they are already bought in or not. Ability to see value in all opinions and negotiate a win-win situation for all.

* **Enhanced public speaking presence** – Continue to grow skills beyond current capabilities, working towards key note speaker at large conferences. Have hosted at Microsoft Build UK, presented at hundreds of meetup groups, customer briefings, vlogs and more.

* **People Management** – Prepare for potential step towards management. Continue to hone coaching/mentoring skills in preparation for this, and identify opportunities for hands-on experience.
